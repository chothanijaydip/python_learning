File Handling in Python

Overview

This project demonstrates basic file handling operations in Python, including writing, reading, and appending data to text files.

Tasks

Task 1: Writing and Reading a File

A file named sample.txt is created and initialized with some text.

The script reads the file and prints its contents line by line.

If the file is not found, an error message is displayed.

Task 2: Writing, Appending, and Reading a File

The user is prompted to enter text, which is written to a file named output.txt.

The user can then enter additional text, which is appended to the same file.

The final content of output.txt is displayed.

If the file is not found, an error message is displayed.

Usage

Run the script in a Python environment.

Follow the prompts to enter text for writing and appending to output.txt.

View the final contents of output.txt in the console.

Error Handling

If a file is not found, a FileNotFoundError is caught, and an appropriate error message is displayed.
