# Python Program: Basic Arithmetic Operations & Greeting Message

## Description
This Python program performs two main tasks:

### Task 1: Arithmetic Operations
The program takes two user inputs as numbers and performs the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

It also includes input validation to check whether the user has entered a valid number. If an empty input or invalid number is provided, an error message is displayed.

### Task 2: Greeting Message
The program prompts the user to enter their first and last name. After receiving valid input, it prints a personalized greeting message. If either field is left empty, an error message is displayed.

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter two numeric values when prompted for arithmetic operations.
3. View the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
4. Enter your first and last name when prompted.
5. Receive a friendly greeting message.

## Example Output
```
Enter the first Number: 10
Enter the second Number: 5
Addition: 15
